## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox model
- Mobile friendly responsive design
- Tailwind utility-first CSS framework (ver. 3+)

### What I learned

- [x] Improved my existing HTML/CSS knownledge
- [x] Tailwind CSS framework fundamentals, guide principles

Configuring and customizing my Tailwind installation:

### **Example:**

> **Creating your own classes:**

```css
/* your input style.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
@layer components {
  /* custom css class */
  .chat-left {
    @apply mobile:text-xs bg-chat-bg-l text-prim-mod-violet rounded-tl-[0.85rem] rounded-tr-[0.85rem] rounded-br-[0.85rem] rounded-bl-md text-[9px] opacity-0;
  }
}
```

> **Usage:**

```html
<!-- Inside html file -->
...

<div
  class="animate-chat-left chat-left mobile:max-w-[60%] my-3 w-max max-w-[68%] p-2"
>
  That sounds great. I'd be happy with that.
</div>

...
```

> **Tailwind configuration file:**

_Custom font colors_

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html'],
  theme: {
    extend: {

      //...

      fontFamily: {
        rubik: ['Rubik', ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
      },

      //...

    }
  },
  ...
}
```
