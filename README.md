Exercises are based on [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## Getting started

1. fork this repo
2. enable GitHub Actions for your fork
3. find appropriate challenge in GitHub Issues
4. create an exercise branch based on remote branch (e.g. `qr_code_component`)
5. download starter files from the corresponding challenge and read the instructions
6. edit files inside challenge directory (e.g. `challenges/qr_code_component`) and add any images to its own `images` subdirectory while previewing it on the server (execute `npm run serve` command)
7. make sure your solution passes tests (execute `npm run test` command)
8. compare screenshots made in `screenshots` directory with the expected design
9. create PR to the matching upstream branch
10. make sure it passes code review
11. merge your exercise branch with your main branch
12. update main `index.html` file (`challenges/index.html`) in your `main` branch to include link to the newest challenge solution
13. repeat steps 3-12 for each exercise

Each challenge has its own directory inside `challenges` that contains HTML file, Tailwind CSS config file and input CSS file just like Tailwind Playground does. Directory `public` is for output only and can be ignored.
